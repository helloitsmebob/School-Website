               Starting on Monday 4/5, SkyView Academy will begin celebrating our 3rd Wish Week.  We are excited to honor this year’s Wish Kid, Kian from Greenwood Village.  Throughout this week-long event, we partner with Make-A-Wish Colorado and their “Kids For Wish Kids” program to feature a child with critical illnesses. We are so excited to see our community come together as we work to raise $5,000 and grant wishes for kids like Kian.  Kian is currently waiting for his wish to be granted! This is a special opportunity for us to demonstrate honorable leadership through service. Though this Wish Week will look different than in past years, there are several opportunities for K-12 students and families to get involved and make this week special.  Many of these will be virtual this year with our own digital fundraising page to contribute to this great cause!
